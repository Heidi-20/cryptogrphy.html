            <p>Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of
                messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end,
                rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed
                for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those
                of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond
                confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity
                authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others <br>
                Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting information
                from a readable state to unintelligible nonsense. The sender of an encrypted message shares the decoding
                technique only with intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature
                often uses the names Alice ("A") for the sender, Bob ("B") for the intended recipient, and Eve
                ("eavesdropper") for the adversary.[5] Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and
                the advent of computers in World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and its
                applications more varied.

                Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic
                algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break
                in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed
                system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore
                termed "computationally secure"; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization
                algorithms, and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated, and if
                necessary, adapted.<br>
                There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited
                computing power, such as the one-time pad, but these schemes are much more difficult to use in practice
                than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes

                Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the
                same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable
                way).
                This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.
                Symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher
                enciphers input in blocks of plaintext as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a
                stream cipher.<br>
                The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs
                that have been designated cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was
                finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted).[34] Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES
                (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) remains quite popular; it is
                used across a wide range of applications<br>

                remote access.[37] Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation
                in quality. Many, even some designed by capable practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL

                Symmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, <br>
                although a message or group of messages can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage
                of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of
                communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext exchanged as
                well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members,<br>
                which very quickly requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret.
                In a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key
                (also, more generally,<br>
                called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a
                public key and a private key

            <p>
                The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus
                permitting its subversion or evasion.<br>
                It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII
                work at Bell Labs, Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key
                material is truly random, never reused, kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater
                length than the message.<br>
                Most ciphers, apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force
                attack, but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to
                the effort needed to make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it
                is proven that the effort required (i.e., "work factor", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of
                any adversary. This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming
                brute force method) can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the
                one-time-pad remains the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad
                encryption cannot be broken, traffic analysis is still possible.<br>
                Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers
                or stream ciphers that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For
                example, a simple brute force attack against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions,
                trying approximately half of the possible keys, to reach a point at which chances are better than even
                that the key sought will have been found. But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis
                attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and
                approximately 243 DES operations.[52] This is a considerable improvement over brute force attacks.<br>
                Public-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. The most famous of
                these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating
                discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time using only a
                classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P
                that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, the
                best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more
                time-consuming than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less
                equivalent size. Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance,
                factoring-based encryption techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this
                reason, public-key cryptosystems based on elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in
                the mid-1990s.

                While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, other attacks on cryptosystems
                are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, and are called side-channel attacks. If a
                cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of
                plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a timing attack to
                break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. An attacker might also study the pattern and
                length of messages to derive valuable information; this is known as traffic analysis[53] and can be
                quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, such as permitting too short
                keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues.
                Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage,
                torture, ...) are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a
                reasonable amount of time compared to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin.
